This project is a deep learning-based application designed to identify and classify images of various kinds of fruits.
Utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the system achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between different fruit types.
This project was developed as part of my second-semester coursework in the 
BTech Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence program at Symbiosis.
